# Non-Functional Test 1: Performance Test

**Objective:** To assess the system's performance by simulating multiple users accessing the API simultaneously.

**Test Details:**
- Use the Artillery framework to conduct a performance test on the API.
- Create a load testing scenario that sends a specified number of requests to the API endpoint.
- Monitor response times, throughput, and any performance degradation.
- Set performance thresholds and compare actual performance against them.

# Non-Functional Test 2: Security Scanning Test

**Objective:** To identify security vulnerabilities by running a security scan on the API.

**Test Details:**
- Use the OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) tool to conduct security scans on the API.
- Automate the security scan process using a script.
- Start ZAP, initiate security scans, and generate a security report.
- Verify that the security report contains relevant findings and vulnerabilities.
- Address any critical vulnerabilities and re-run the scan to ensure they are resolved.

## Framework for Automating Non-Functional Tests

1. **Artillery Framework for Performance Testing:**
   - Artillery is an open-source load testing framework that allows you to simulate real-world scenarios to assess performance.
   - It supports defining scenarios, specifying load patterns, and monitoring metrics like response times, throughput, and errors.
   - You can automate the performance test using Artillery scripts and generate detailed performance reports.

2. **OWASP ZAP for Security Scanning:**
   - OWASP ZAP is a widely-used security testing tool for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs.
   - It offers a variety of scanning options, including spidering, active scanning, and reporting.
   - You can automate ZAP using its API and command-line interface to run security scans and generate detailed reports.

*Note: Both Artillery and OWASP ZAP can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that non-functional tests are performed consistently during the development process.*
